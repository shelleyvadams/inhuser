## Name
Identify the stakeholders, their activities, and the surrounding context: organizations and agencies, providers and service users, populations and service areas, services and the needs they meet.

## Describe
Get the right kind of information and the proper level of detail.

## Locate
A single map marker can't accurately represent a city, multi-site organization, or mobile service. Different kinds of places need different types of location data, and they need to work with smartphone navigation apps, online web maps, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and everything in between.

## Align
Don't silo existing information, leverage it. Re-use data from government reporting, search engine optimization (SEO), and social media marketing through alignment with a diverse set of vocabularies including the Federal Enterprise Architecture, Government Data vocabulary, vCard-RDF, Schema.org and Open Graph Protocol.
